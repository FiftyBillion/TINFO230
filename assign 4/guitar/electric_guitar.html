                <h3>Introduce Electric Guitar</h3>
                
                <!-- this introduction paragraph is retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar -->
                <p class="content">An electric guitar is a guitar that uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration 
                    of its strings into electrical signals. The vibration occurs when a guitar player strums, plucks, 
                    fingerpicks, slaps or taps the strings. The pickup used to sense the vibration generally uses 
                    electromagnetic induction to do so, though other technologies exist. In any case, the signal generated 
                    by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is fed to a guitar amplifier before 
                    being sent to the speaker(s), which converts it into audible sound.</p>
                
                <p class="content">Since the output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, 
                    it can be electronically altered to change the timbre of the sound. Often, the signal is modified 
                    using effects such as reverb, and distortion and "overdrive"; the latter effect is considered to 
                    be a key element of electric blues guitar music and rock guitar playing.</p>
