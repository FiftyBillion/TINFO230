			<h3>Kristopher Dane</h3>
				<p>Dr. Kristopher Dane is the Director of Digital Design for Thornton Tomasetti 
				, an international structural engineering firm. He has 11 years of experience 
				managing teams, administering technology, and developing custom tools to support 
				the design of over 5-million square feet of structures around the world. His 
				experience includes working with clients to set modeling strategy for complex 
				projects including the adoption of project specific workflows such as quantity 
				control and 3D visualization.
				
				<p>Dane has in-depth technical knowledge in various parametric modeling platforms 
				such as Revit, CATIA/ Digital Project, Rhino and Grasshopper, as well as data 
				exchange through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) of Revit, Excel, 
				Bentley RAM, CSI SAP. Knowledge of programming languages includes VBA, C#, 
				and PHP.</p>

				<p>In collaboration with the CIO, CTO, and business leaders, Dane oversees a 
				group charged with improving BIM workflows across all practices and making 
				strategic investments in future technology. This includes adopting best 
				practices from around the world to support TTâ€™s 50 offices while maintaining 
				consistency in internal workflows. Dane works closely with offices in the United 
				Kingdom including in London, Warrington, Edinburgh, and Ballymena to develop 
				BIM and business strategy. Given the leading role of PAS 1192, Dane has been 
				promoting its use as the baseline for standards within TT.</p>

				<p>In his doctoral work at the George Washington University, Dane studied the 
				influence of building geometry on active shooter events. Dane is now working to 
				incorporate such simulations into the building design process through a systems 
				engineering approach.</p>

			<h3>Mailyn Abon</h3>
				<p>This is my third year at the University of Washington-Tacoma in progress of 
				obtaining my degree in Information Technology. I express interest in web 
				development, but also in Cybersecurity. Some experiences that I have related 
				to this project include, web design, human computer interactions, systems 
				analysis and design, as well as technical communications.</p><br>

			<h3>Hussein Aljanabi</h3>
				<p>I am post baccalaureate student at University Of Washington Tacoma. I am 
				willing to get my second bachelor degree in information technology. This is 
				my first quarter at UWT. I am enjoying the teamwork throughout this project. 
				This project helped  me to apply what have learned in TINFO230 class in real 
				world experience.</p><br>

			<h3>Paul Duma</h3>
				<p>I am a University of Washington Tacoma student in my junior year working on 
				my BS in IT. This website project that we completed as a group concludes the 
				Foundations Of Web Design And Programming class. It helped us expand and 
				improve our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge while also being a useful 
				active shooter preparedness resource.</p><br>

			<h3>Po-I Wu</h3>
				<p>I am a junior student at the University of Washington Tacoma, and major in 
				Information Technology. This project is a great experience for team communication 
				and web development. I believe that not only the technical skill, but also the 
				communication skill and the responsibility are important for an IT student.</p><br>
