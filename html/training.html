            <article>
                <p>Active Shooting: an individual actively engaged in killing or attempting
                to kill people in a confined and populated area.</p>
                <p>Our goal for training module is to teach people what to do if they are in an active shooting event.</p>
            </article>

                    <li>Sign up to receive local emergency alerts and register your work

                </ul>
            <h4><u>Make a plan</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make a plan with your family, and ensure everyone knows what they would do, if confronted with an active shooter.</li>
                    <li>Look for the two nearest exits anywhere you go, and have an escape path in mind &amp; identify places you could hide.</li>
                    <li>Understand the plans for individuals with disabilities or other access and functional needs.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4><u>What to do during an active shooting event</u></h4>
                <h5>&emsp;&emsp;RUN and escape, if possible.</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Getting away from the shooter or shooters is the top priority.</li>
                        <li>Leave your belongings behind and get away.</li>
                        <li>Help others escape, if possible, but evacuate regardless of whether others agree to follow.</li>
                        <li>Warn and prevent individuals from entering an area where the active shooter may be.</li>
                        <li>Call 911 when you are safe, and describe shooter, location, and weapons.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>&emsp;&emsp;HIDE, if escape is not possible.</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Get out of the shooter’s view and stay very quiet.</li>
                        <li>Silence all electronic devices and make sure they won’t vibrate.</li>
                        <li>Lock and block doors, close blinds, and turn off lights.</li>
                        <li>Don’t hide in groups- spread out along walls or hide separately to make it more difficult for the shooter.</li>
                        <li>Try to communicate with police silently. Use text message or social media to tag your location,
                            or put a sign in a window.</li>
                        <li>Stay in place until law enforcement gives you the all clear.</li>
                        <li>Your hiding place should be out of the shooter's view and provide protection
                            if shots are fired in your direction</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>&emsp;&emsp;FIGHT as an absolute last resort.</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Commit to your actions and act as aggressively as possible against the shooter.</li>
                        <li>Recruit others to ambush the shooter with makeshift weapons like chairs,
                            fire extinguishers, scissors, books, etc.</li>
                        <li>Be prepared to cause severe or lethal injury to the shooter.</li>
                        <li>Throw items and improvise weapons to distract and disarm the shooter.</li>
                    </ul>
            <h4><u>What to do after</u></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep hands visible and empty.</li>
                    <li>Know that law enforcement’s first task is to end the incident, and they may have to pass injured along the way.</li>
                    <li>Officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, and/or handguns and may use pepper
                        spray or tear gas to control the situation.</li>
                    <li>Officers will shout commands and may push individuals to the ground for their safety.</li>
                    <li>Follow law enforcement instructions and evacuate in the direction they come from, unless otherwise instructed.</li>
                    <li>Take care of yourself first, and then you may be able to help the wounded before first responders arrive.</li>
                    <li>If the injured are in immediate danger, help get them to safety.</li>
                    <li>While you wait for first responder to arrive, provide first aid. 
                        Apply direct pressure to wounded areas and use tourniquets if you have been trained to do so.</li>
                    <li>Turn wounded people onto their sides if they are unconscious and keep them warm.</li>
                    <li>Consider seeking professional help for you and your family to cope with the long-term effects of the trauma.</li>
