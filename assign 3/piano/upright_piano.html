                <h3>Introduce Upright Piano</h3>
                
                <!-- upright piano introduction: https://www.britannica.com/art/upright-piano -->
                <p class="content">Upright piano, musical instrument in which the soundboard and plane of the strings run vertically, 
                    perpendicular to the keyboard, thus taking up less floor space than the normal grand piano. 
                    Upright pianos are made in various heights; the shortest are called spinets or consoles, 
                    and these are generally considered to have an inferior tone resulting from the shortness of their strings 
                    and their relatively small soundboards. The larger upright pianos were quite popular in the later 19th 
                    and early 20th centuries. The action (hammer and damper mechanism) of the upright differs from 
                    the grand-piano action mainly in that upright action is returned to a resting position by means of springs 
                    rather than by gravity alone, as in a grand. This, in part, accounts for the characteristic “touch” of uprights, 
                    which is distinct from that of grands. The chief advantages of upright pianos lie in their modest price and compactness; 
                    they are instruments for the home and school, not for the concert stage.</p>
                <p class="content">The majority of upright pianos have strings running upward from the bottom of the case, 
                    near the floor; this design is owed to John Isaac Hawkins, an Englishman who lived in the United States 
                    in about 1800 and became an important piano maker in Philadelphia. Earlier, the strings started upward 
                    from near the level of the keys; these instruments were necessarily much taller and lent themselves 
                    to various decorative designs, among them lyre-shaped; round; the “pyramid” model (Pyramidenflügel; 1745) 
                    of the Saxon organ-builder Ernst Christian Friderici, with both sides sloping upward to the flat top; 
                    and the “giraffe-style” design (Giraffenflügel; 1804) of Martin Seuffert of Vienna, 
                    with one side straight and one bent, as on a grand piano.</p>
