                <h3>Introduce Drum Kit</h3>
                
                <!-- this introduction paragraph is retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit -->
                <p class="content">A drum kit — also called a drum set, trap set (a term using a contraction of the word, 
                    "contraption"), or simply drums — is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, 
                    which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,[1] with drumsticks held in both hands, 
                    and the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. 
                    A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs 
                    high-level classification 2) and idiophones – most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock 
                    and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).[2] In the 2000s, some kits also 
                    include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic 
                    instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used. </p>
