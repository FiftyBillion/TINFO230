                <p>The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE) curriculum stresses computer programming and people centered software development processes. The CSSE degree program offers a multidisciplinary approach that will enable students to develop a wide range of competencies needed for success in the dynamic and varied field of software applications. These include analysis and problem solving techniques; communication and business management skills; in-depth understanding of the software design and development process; and a solid technical foundation to allow students to continue to learn new and complex techniques. Students gain essential knowledge in object oriented programming, data structures, analysis of algorithms, software engineering, management principles, hardware architecture and operating systems.</p>
